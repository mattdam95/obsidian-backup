# Present perfect

In general, the **present perfect is a mix of the present and the past**. It is used for actions in the past that have significance in the present.
- to talk about past experiences when you don't say when something happened, often with ever or never.
- with just, yet, and already.
- with superlatives and the first, second, last time, etc.
- **for finished actions (when no time is specified) which have present results**

**To form the present perfect tense we use the auxiliary verb “to have” in the present simple tense, as well as the past participle of the principal verb**. For regular verbs, the past participle of verb is the regular past simple form (verb + “**-ed**”). See the lesson on the [past simple](https://www.curso-ingles.com/en/learn/courses/intermediate-level/verb-tenses-past/past-simple) for more information on forming the past tense.

| Subject          | Auxiliary | Short Form                   | Past Participle            |
| ---------------- | --------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| I, you, we, they | **have**  | I’ve, you’ve, we’ve, they’ve | talked, learned, traveled… |
| he, she, it      | **has**   | he’s, she’s, it’s            | talked, learned, traveled… |

# Present Perfect Continuous

**The present perfect continuous is used for actions or events that began in the past and continue into the present**.

As with the present perfect simple, we use the auxiliary verb “**to have**” as well as “**been**” (the past participle of the verb “**to be**”) and the verb+ing.

|Subject|Auxiliary|Verb+ing|
|---|---|---|
|I, you, we, they|**have been**|talking, studying, waiting…|
|he, she, it|**has been**|talking, studying, waiting…|
